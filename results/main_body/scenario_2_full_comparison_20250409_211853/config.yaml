scenario:
  issue: Should the UK's ties to Europe be stronger or weaker?
  agent_opinions:
    Agent 1: When we was in Europe we had good trade with them , The decision to leave
      was very bad for united kindom . We need to put the vote again to the British
      public i am sure this time the decision would be to remain
    Agent 2: The natural evolution of our species has been to grow into ever bigger
      "tribes". Families ruled by their patriarchs became tribes ruled by elders became
      countries ruled by governments. It made sense that countries would evolve separately
      since they were geographically separate with no means of communication. Now
      our world is so connected, it is inevitable that we evolve into ever larger
      units such as the United States and the European Union. Eventually we will become
      a multi-planetary species ruled by an Earth government. To sever ties with Europe
      is a step in the wrong direction.
    Agent 3: Although we did exit EU few years ago, we are geographically and economically
      in proximity to most EU countries. Several geographic, financial, political
      and economical parameters are intertwined with our neighbouring countries and,
      it would be advantageous to be in good relations to fully harness our economic,
      political, and financial facilities.
    Agent 4: I believe the UK's ties to Europe should be stronger, as it would make
      trade deals easier to negotiate. This would allow us to benefit from a larger
      array of goods, which would make our imports cheaper. I also believe that closer
      ties with Europe in terms of immigration policies should occur as our immigration
      policy doesn't coincide with other nations around us. I believe a more united
      Europe would help all countries grow more through the movement of free labour,
      goods and services and more.
    Agent 5: I think they should be stronger, as all the countries of Europe, except
      us, are part of the EU, and it makes Britain more isolated. Countries are stronger
      I believe when they work together with other countries and are open to the influence
      of other countries. I believe that leaving the EU was a step backwards and done
      for the wrong reasons. We are not the country we were 100 or even 50 years ago
      and the world is changing so much that we cannot afford to not be part of Europe.

  predefined_statement: The UK's ties to Europe should be stronger. This is because,
    although the UK did leave the EU, we are geographically and economically in proximity
    to most EU countries. Several geographic, financial, political and economical
    parameters are intertwined with our neighbouring countries and, it would be advantageous
    to be in good relations to fully harness our economic, political, and financial
