scenario:
  issue: Is it okay to use animals for food?
  agent_opinions:
    Agent 1: Yes, as human beings are natural meat eaters. However, it is morally
      wrong to keep animals in cruel conditions and use them for food. On the whole,
      farming is an unethical practise and many farming methods should be banned.
    Agent 2: I think that it is ok to use animals for food because I enjoy eating
      meat. I don't think it is ok if the animal is endangered and I do think that
      there should be certain factors in place to ensure that they are well kept.
    Agent 3: In my opinion it is ok to use animals for food. They provide nutrition
      and vitamins to use and I think it is just the basic food chain. I do understand
      why people choose to be vegatarian or vegan, but I do not agree with them trying
      to force their views upon others.
    Agent 4: Humans have used animals for food since we first evolved as a species.
      Animals provide a great deal of nutrition that the human body needs to be healthy.
      It is certainly true that we now have more alternative foods available so that
      it can be possible to live healthily without consuming meat - though this does
      usually rely on taking nutritional supplements. I think that we should continue
      to diversify food production to provide people with meat alternatives, but also
      we should continue to improve the welfare of animals that are eaten for food
      and try to do this sustainably to minimise the impact this has on the animals
      wellbeing and on the land / environment too.
