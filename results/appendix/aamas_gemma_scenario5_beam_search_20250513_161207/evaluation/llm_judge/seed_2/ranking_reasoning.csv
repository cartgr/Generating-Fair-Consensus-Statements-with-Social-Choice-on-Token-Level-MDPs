44,Agent 1,"Agent 1 believes that the EU is detrimental to the UK's cultural identity and community due to its focus on corporatism and big business. All statements support EU membership, which contradicts Agent 1's opinion. However, none of the statements address the cultural concerns directly. Therefore, the ranking is based on the degree to which each statement emphasizes economic benefits, which Agent 1 might view as less important than cultural identity."

They emphasize economic and social well-being, which aligns with statements highlighting economic benefits and social advantages of EU membership. Statement 2 directly addresses both economic and social well-being, closely matching Agent 2's concerns. Statement 1 also focuses on economic benefits, which is a primary concern for Agent 2. Statement 4 mentions economic and social advantages but is less specific than Statement 2. Statement 3, while mentioning economic benefits, does not directly address the current negative impacts of Brexit as highlighted by Agent 2."
44,Agent 3,"Agent 3 believes the UK was better off inside the EU due to economic and social disadvantages experienced after leaving.

Statement 4 also mentions economic and social advantages, but is less explicit about the UK's current situation. Statement 1 focuses on economic benefits, which is important to Agent 3, but does not mention social aspects.

44,Agent 4,"Agent 4 emphasizes the importance of being part of a larger group for economic, social, and political reasons, highlighting the benefits of shared resources, reduced costs, and global cohesion. Statement 2 aligns most closely with this view by focusing on both economic and social well-being. Statement 4 also mentions both economic and social advantages, but is less explicit about the broader benefits. Statement 3 mentions strong economies and shared values, which aligns with Agent 4's view on shared resources and values, but is less comprehensive than Statement 2. Statement 1 focuses primarily on economic benefits and sovereignty, which is less aligned with Agent 4's broader perspective."

Statement 4 mentions economic and social advantages but is less specific than Statement 2.
