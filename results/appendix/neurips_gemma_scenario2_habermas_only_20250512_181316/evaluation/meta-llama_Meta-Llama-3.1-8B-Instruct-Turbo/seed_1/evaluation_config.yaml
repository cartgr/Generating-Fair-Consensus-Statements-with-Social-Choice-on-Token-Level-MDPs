    agent_opinions:
      Agent 1: Yes taxes should be increased in order to fund a more comprehensive
        benefits system because this is the best means to create a safe, secure and
        productive society in the long term. Especially in recent times, with the
        ongoing challenges countries across the world are facing, it would be tantamount
        to negligence to either keep benefits in their current form or reduce them.  Comprehensive
        benefits systems that will protect people in all kinds of situations are one
        of the hallmarks of a successful country which shows that it cares actively
        for its citizens and that everyone is invested in that care.
      Agent 2: "I think we need a better benefits system than the one we already have.\
        \  I think it needs a complete overhaul, it is difficult for those that are\
        \ most vulnerable and at risk to access the support they need, and what is\
        \ available is just not sufficient.  Take carers for example, they have to\
        \ take care of someone for a minimum of 35 hours per week, but only receive\
        \ the equivalent of \xA31.99 to pay for this from the Government. Increasing\
        \ taxes would allow reform and to support people like carers better."
      Agent 3: I believe the benefits system is inadequate, recent studies by JRF
        and similar show this. I thus think it should be more comprehensive as there
        are anomolies between the help available through different benefits such as
        income and contribution based.  Rates should be increased across the board.
        Some tax rises to fund this would be justified, but there is no point adding
        to the tax burden of those on the lowest incomes who may be in receipt of
        top up benefit as it is taking away what is already given, so I would propose
        taxing the well off more instead.
      Agent 4: I think it is a good idea as we could improve the wellfare of many
        people. I think the rich should also be taxed more to help other people. I
        like the idea of everyone having better access to the things they need such
        as medical care. Some things are to expensive for people on lower incomes
        to afford.
      Agent 5: I believe that the tax system should be revised, meaning that the highest
        earners in this country will pay a larger amount of tax. I also believe that
        the level of tax that corporations pay should be increased. In the last decade,
        the gap between the lowest and highest earners has only been increasing. On
        top of this, vicious cuts to benefits and services have hit the least well
        off in society very hard.
    issue: Should we increase taxes to fund a more comprehensive benefits system?
