    agent_opinions:
      Agent 1: It is important that children feel happy, safe and comfortable in school,
        so we should take into account their views. However it is also important to
        ensure every child gets a well-rounded and complete education. This means
        they should not have the option to drop out before they have reached a level
        of qualification that will stand them in good stead for their future life.
        Young people may not have the perspective to understand the importance of
        this for their futures.
      Agent 2: Their views are important because it affects them directly, and it's
        also important to engage children and ensure that they are actively learning
        rather than exposing them to content they find completely uninteresting and
        therefore fail to engage with. However, there are certain topics that may
        be boring to children but are extremely important for them to learn for their
        future, such as maths and science, so it's arguably more important to provide
        adequate support to their learning so they can find enjoyment in their learning
        regardless. Of course, adults have a better view in terms of what would benefit
        a child - as a child may choose things they enjoy short-term but that may
        not benefit them in the long term - so they should dictate what children learn
        up to a certain age. Regardless, children should be notified about the content
        of their learning, and feedback should be taken from them to ensure they are
        benefitting in the long run.
      Agent 3: yes i do believe that children's views on their education are very
        important. Children are ultimately those in receipt of the education and will
        respond appropriately as to whether they deem it functional.
      Agent 4: Children have a right to have a say in their education. However, the
        age of the child should be taken into account. The education system is proven
        to work well but all learning styles are different and not every teaching
        method suits every child.
      Agent 5: Yes as at the end of the day it's their future.  If they are being
        taught things that are not relevant to modern day life it's pointless.  They
        should be heard
    issue: Are children's views about their education important?
