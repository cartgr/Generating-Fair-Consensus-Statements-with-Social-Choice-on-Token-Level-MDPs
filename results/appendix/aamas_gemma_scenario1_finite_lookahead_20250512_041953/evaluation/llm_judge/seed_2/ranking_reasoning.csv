44,Agent 1,"Agent 1 believes genetic information should be private but acknowledges exceptions for research and family, provided the person consents. Statement 1 aligns best with this view by emphasizing protection, authorized access, and informed consent. Statement 2 focuses on privacy and autonomy but lacks mention of consent for research, making it less aligned. Statement 3 is the least aligned as it only mentions privacy and confidentiality without addressing consent or exceptions."
44,Agent 2,"Agent 2 believes that genetic information should be private because it belongs to the individual, with exceptions for medical use. Statement 2 aligns best with this view by emphasizing privacy and autonomy. Statement 1 also supports privacy but introduces conditions for access, which is less aligned with the agent's primary focus on ownership. Statement 3 is the least aligned as it lacks the emphasis on individual ownership and autonomy."
44,Agent 3,"Agent 3 is slightly in favor of sharing genetic information if it is used appropriately to help prevent and cure illnesses. Statement 1 aligns best with this view as it allows for sharing under controlled conditions for legitimate medical research. Statement 2 emphasizes privacy and autonomy, which does not align with Agent 3's slight favor towards sharing for medical benefits. Statement 3 focuses solely on privacy and confidentiality, which is the least aligned with Agent 3's opinion."
44,Agent 4,"Agent 4 emphasizes the importance of treating genetic information as private to prevent discrimination and potential harm to future offspring. Statement 2 aligns closely with this view by highlighting privacy, individual autonomy, and safeguarding against misuse. Statement 1 also supports privacy but focuses more on access for medical research, which is less aligned with Agent 4's concerns about discrimination and future harm. Statement 3 is the most general, lacking specific references to misuse or future risks, making it the least aligned with Agent 4's detailed concerns."
