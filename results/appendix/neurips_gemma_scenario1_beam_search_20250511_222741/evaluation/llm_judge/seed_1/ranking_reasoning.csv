43,Agent 1,"Agent 1 believes genetic information should be private but acknowledges exceptions for research or family, provided the individual consents. Statement 1 aligns best with this view by emphasizing privacy and consent for specific purposes. Statement 2 also respects privacy and considers research benefits but is less explicit about consent. Statements 3 and 4 simply state genetic code should be private, lacking the nuance of consent and potential exceptions that Agent 1 considers important."
43,Agent 2,"Agent 2 believes that genetic code should be private because it belongs to the individual, with exceptions primarily for medical purposes. Statement 3 and Statement 4 align closely with the agent's view by emphasizing privacy without additional conditions. Statement 1 aligns well by mentioning explicit consent and medical research, which fits the agent's exception for medical use. Statement 2, while mentioning privacy and medical advancements, introduces broader considerations that are not explicitly part of the agent's opinion."
43,Agent 3,"Agent 3 is slightly in favor of sharing genetic information if it is used appropriately, particularly for preventing and curing illnesses. Statement 1 aligns best with this view as it emphasizes consent and specific purposes like medical research. Statement 2 also considers the potential benefits for research and medical advancements, which aligns with Agent 3's slight favorability towards sharing genetic information for appropriate uses. Statements 3 and 4 simply state that genetic code should be private, which does not align with Agent 3's nuanced view that sharing can be beneficial if done correctly."
43,Agent 4,"Agent 4 emphasizes the importance of treating genetic code as private information to prevent discrimination and potential harm to future offspring. The agent is concerned about the misuse of genetic information and stresses the need for precaution. Statement 3 and Statement 4 align closely with the agent's view by directly stating that genetic code should be private, without introducing other considerations. Statement 1 aligns well by emphasizing privacy and consent, which are important to the agent, but it introduces the idea of access for specific purposes, which is not explicitly supported by the agent. Statement 2, while mentioning privacy, also brings in the potential benefits for research and medical advancements, which is not a focus of the agent's concerns."
