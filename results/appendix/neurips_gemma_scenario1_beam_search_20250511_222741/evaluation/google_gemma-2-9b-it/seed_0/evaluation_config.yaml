  scenario:
    agent_opinions:
      Agent 1: I'd like to think it should be considered private information and for
        the persons privacy to be respected. However, it may be important for research
        or for the biological family. If the person is open for it, then their opinion
        should be respected
      Agent 2: A persons genetic code should be considered private information for
        the sole reason it belongs to them. I can only think of medical case use scenarios
        when it may be useful to someone else in the case of faulty genes etc being
        eradicated by using someone else's stem cells or dna to help in this.
      Agent 3: The majority of all the genetic code is identical between people. I
        am undecided on the matter, the differences make us different. But by sharing
        all the genetic code, this may help prevent and cure illnesses so I would
        be slightly in favour if used appropriately.
      Agent 4: I believe that a person's genetic code should be considered private
        information, the same way you wouldn't give out your address or personal information
        to strangers, it should cover your genetic makeup as well as it could be used
        to screen out people with specific genetic markers and for discrimination
        in the future. Having access to your genetic information also has the added
        risk of being potentially harmful to any offspring in the future and I believe
        that precaution should be taken to ensure that your genetic code is safe from
        abuse by others.
    issue: Should a person's genetic code be considered private information?
