scenario:
  issue: Should a person's genetic code be considered private information?
  agent_opinions:
    Agent 1: I'd like to think it should be considered private information and for
      the persons privacy to be respected. However, it may be important for research
      or for the biological family. If the person is open for it, then their opinion
      should be respected
    Agent 2: A persons genetic code should be considered private information for the
      sole reason it belongs to them. I can only think of medical case use scenarios
      when it may be useful to someone else in the case of faulty genes etc being
      eradicated by using someone else's stem cells or dna to help in this.
    Agent 3: The majority of all the genetic code is identical between people. I am
      undecided on the matter, the differences make us different. But by sharing all
      the genetic code, this may help prevent and cure illnesses so I would be slightly
      in favour if used appropriately.
    Agent 4: I believe that a person's genetic code should be considered private information,
      the same way you wouldn't give out your address or personal information to strangers,
      it should cover your genetic makeup as well as it could be used to screen out
      people with specific genetic markers and for discrimination in the future. Having
      access to your genetic information also has the added risk of being potentially
      harmful to any offspring in the future and I believe that precaution should
      be taken to ensure that your genetic code is safe from abuse by others.
