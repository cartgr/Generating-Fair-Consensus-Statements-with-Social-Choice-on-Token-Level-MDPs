scenario:
  issue: Is the UK better off inside or outside of the European Union?
  agent_opinions:
    Agent 1: The EU is becoming increasingly bloated and ineffective. Due to its size
      there appears to be more of an emphasis on corporatism and big business to the
      detriment of individual countries cultural identities. These are the sort of
      traditions and way of life that foster meaning and a sense of community. With
      larger organisations this individual flavour is lost to the detrimental of an
      individual and a collective of any size
    Agent 2: Because of the incompetent and unwilling handling of Brexit, it seems
      clear we would currently be better off inside Europe. Our trade, both import
      and export, has been damaged badly with no sign of a satisfactory resolution.
      Additionally the administration for individuals and business for travel and
      residence have become a deep negative. The mood of the nation is also very divided
      although I am unsure whether that can be overcomeby a return to EU membership.
    Agent 3: Uk was better off inside the Europen union, the reason is that if we
      compare advantages and disadvantages then we notice that we are wosre off after
      leaving Europen union. Food prices are going higher and it is not good socially.
      Not good for economy,
    Agent 4: i feel that there is strenght in number, that the uk has been and remains
      so closely connected to euroipe both geographically and politically that being
      within it would be better. As a small island our resources are limited. The
      older generation may want the good old times but they really no longer exist
      and progress must be made. Geographical borders no longer limit us, we have
      better transport, education, we are more mobile, multilingual. We should be
      more focused on humanity and the health and wealth of the world as a whole.
      Connecting the world into bigger groups will bring better cohesion and perhaps
      reduce risks of conflict. shared resources, reduced costs. Young people wish
      to travel, to widen their horizons
    Agent 5: The UK is most definitely better off within the EU and has seen many
      negatives since leaving and very few positives. The interconnected nature of
      European economies means there is much to be gained from formal ties of the
      EU - moving from having a number of countries on their own not being particularly
      powerful or influential on the world stage, to a significant international power
      when coming together as one. Being in the EU generally means improved economic
      outcomes, more jobs, more investment, higher wages etc, and is very much a beneficial
      thing.
