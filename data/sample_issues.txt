ISSUE:
Should we encourage elderly people to work longer?

OPINIONS (10):
1. no not al all, our retirement age is already too high by about.

2. No because it is just not right they have worked all their lives and when they are elderly the health is not the same as when you are young .

3. I believe elderly people should not be encouraged to work and I also want age limits to be placed on some elected offices. Old age as much as it is a blessing comes with certain issues that may interfere with their decision-making in the work-place

4. Absolutely not! Elderly people have worked enough by the time they get to retirement age, it will only be the poor elderly people who are forced to work longer! You won't see the likes of the rich people working at an elderly age, because they're well off enough to be able to afford to take early retirement. Meanwhile the UK retirement age keeps increasing because they don't want people to have any retirement clearly! Work yourself to your dead is the torys motive! Let elderly people enjoy their last years on earth without having to worry about working themselves to death!

5. I think that we should give elderly people the opportunities to work longer if this is what they wish to do. We should not discriminate against them due to age, and should ensure that workplaces are fully accessible to them. However, we should also accept that many people do not want to work longer. Therefore we should ensure that our social security system does not force elderly people to work longer through necessity. Rather this should be a personal choice which each person is free to come to their own decision about.

6. No I don't think we should. The retirement age is acceptable as it currently stands and elders are entitled to their retirement. Also health issues could affect older people.

7. Elderly people who have worked all their lives deserve to enjoy their retirement and should only be encouraged to work if they want to. There is a huge difference in the health and physical fitness between someone who has done a physical job all their lives to someone who has had a sedentary job in an office for example. Some people would enjoy continuing to work as it gives them pleasure and also company which they might be lacking at home. I think it should be an individuals personal choice.

8. I feel we shouldn't encourage elderly people to work longer. People have to work long enough and should be encouraged to enjoy their retirement. Obviously, people should be able to work in their old age if they wish to, but I feel it's necessary they vacate their jobs in order to provide opportunities for younger members of society. I think the economy would benefit from having younger, fitter and more career-minded workforce.

9. I belive that as we are living longer lives we should encourage elderly people to work longer. They do not have to work full-time, but I have see in Japan where older folk work in schoolsd to help kids learn and its a good two-way relationship, for young to learn and respect there elders and the elders also get a buzz from seeing and helping the children.

10. I feel that once you have worked for a number of years, you are entitled to having retirement! You have given into the system in terms of national insurance and tax, and you have given service. You deserve to retire. The government needs to ensure that the necessary funds are available to provide a basic pension for all that require one, and people need to be encourage to take a pension of their own (private). The older a person gets, the harder it can be to do their work to their best ability. In some professions this might be incredibly difficult such as physical labour and tasks where a more youthful figure is better suited (such as teaching). There is nothing wrong with becoming a volunteer or carrying on working for those who wish to do so, and I feel strongly that the choice to retire should be made available to all once tey reach a milestone age. The milestone age is currently too high in my opinion.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
In general, elderly people should not be encouraged to work, and we should not impose additional conditions such as age limits on elected officials. However, it should be noted that some elderly people may want to work and that they should be supported to do so if they wish. This should be a personal choice and should not be something which is imposed upon them by a social security system which does not offer sufficient support for those who do not wish to work.

ISSUE:
Should we be using new gene editing techniques to prevent children being born with genetic disorders?

OPINIONS (5):
1. I was a little unsure on this, it really depends on how the techniques are carried out and also what negative effects it could have when the child is born. There would be a lot of factors to look into, especially if the technique could cause other problems in the future. 

2. I really do not believe that we should be messing with the fabrics of our core beings in out genes. i think this could lead to potentially harmful things happening and being created. I do understand that genetic disorders are a sad thing, nut the are part of natural evolution and we should not be messing with it.

3. Gene editing techniques give us the option to reduce the pain caused to families by genetic diseases. Families who know they carry a genetic disease could be given the chance to have a baby free from that. It would mean that parents would have a choice to prevent their child being born with a genetic disease and this is an option that could change the world.

4. Gene editing, while a great advancement in food and animals, shouldn't be used by human because that could lead to the population being skewed. There are countries where a certain sex is preferred and that will only harm the population as they age--there would be an imbalance. This imbalance could have negative repurcutions when it comes to resource allocation. Another negative side of gene editing is that it could result in 'designer babies' whereby people prefer a certain feature over the genetically possible variations. I think screening for genetic disorders is the better option as it disallows vanity. 

5. yes i think we should,it would ensure that all children are born healthy and can lead normal healthy happy lives  and would also stop the worry and stress parents face when their child is born with a genetic disorder,it would also save money on the nhs treating children with disorders

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
Gene editing techniques have the potential to reduce the pain caused to families by genetic diseases. The pain, especially for families who know they carry a genetic disease, can be substantial. We need to be aware of the potential negative consequences, such as the increase in designer babies, and the future effects that may arise. Therefore, gene editing should be looked into more deeply, before making a final decision.

ISSUE:
Should a government guarantee every citizen access to a university education?

OPINIONS (5):
1. No, university education should be only for those equipped to deal with it and form whom would benefit properly.

2. I disagree that the government should be responsible for "guaranteeing" anyone a university education. University is a priviledge that should be reserved for those with high IQ and ambition, with a clear view of which field they want to develop their understanding. Places at university should be granted on the basis of ability, with only the highest achievers able to attend. By giving every citizen access to university education would only cheapen the value of a degree and would make it more difficult for employers to recognise the best, hardest-working and most committed candidates. By not going to university, those with skills aligned with other fields can gain important work experience and take on apprenticeships, etc.

3. yes they should. it shouldnt be about money and if you can afford it or not. everyone should be entitled to a proper education. this would help our economy as more people would be in jobs so the unemployment rate would be lowered.

4. I don't think a government should guarantee every citizen access to a university education.  A university education is not appropriate or necessary for every citizen - some don't want it and some aren't suited to it.  What a government should do is provide access to university education to those who might otherwise miss out on it and both want and would benefit from the education.  

5. I believe that every citizen deserves the right to go into further education, and should not have to worry about a lifetime of debts to pay off throughout there life, I think there should be a small percentage that university students should pay, bit the majority should be subsidised through the government.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
We have come to the conclusion that the government should not guarantee every citizen access to a university education.  We believe that it should be available to all, but only to those who can show they are equipped to deal with it and would benefit properly.  It is not appropriate for everyone, and it is not necessary for everyone.  We also believe that the government should provide access to university education to those who might otherwise miss out on it and both want and would benefit from the education.  We believe that providing this access will help narrow the rich/poor divide that exists within further education.  The cost of providing the access would be offset by the extra educated and qualified graduates it produces.

ISSUE:
Should we legalise marijuana?

OPINIONS (5):
1. I believe marijuana should be legalised because, as far as I'm aware, it has no worse affects or consequences than smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol. Policing the use of marijuana is a massive strain on public resources, which could be better allocated elsewhere. It makes criminals of petty users and its use being illegal makes it more of a gateway drug than it needs to be.

2. Marijuana should be legalised as, considering its consumption will remain high regardless, legalising the substance will provide positive opportunities to regulate the industry. Firstly, official safety standards could be set regarding the sale of marijuana to ensure that the product has not been laced or tampered with, and this would reduce the danger of using marijuana. Additionally, there will be less need for illegal drug dealing which will likely reduce the likelihood of violence and gang presence in the marijuana industry.  There is an opportunity to tax the sale of marijuana (this could be an increased tax as it is a demerit good or just simply through VAT) and this increase in tax revenue could be re-invested into education or healthcare.

3. I do not think that marijuana should be legalised. While some believe that legalising marijuana will reduce criminality in the dealing and production of it, it will increase black market growers and dealers. These could potentially be more dangerous and untrustworthy and lead to people being put into dangerous situations. Alongside this, the medical benefits of marijuana have not been conclusively confirmed, which would be the only argument for legalising it. In addition, marijuana is an addictive substance which can have very negative psychological impacts on people, such as increasing paranoia, anxiety and even cause panic attacks. Therefore, I do not believe the pros outweigh the cons in legalising marijuana. 

4. I am personally very torn on this subject. In a wider context, and compared to other drugs, I would say that marijuana is one of the less 'controversial' or dangerous illegal substances. However, there is the argument that it could be a 'gateway' to other drugs. Furthermore, a close relative developed schizophrenia in his forties, and the doctors linked the potential cause to smoking marijuana throughout his life. I'm realistic that there may well have been other causes. On the other hand, I know people who have used it for medicinal purposes. This includes people with neurological conditions and people suffering from cancer. I do see that marijuana may help people medicinally, and I would support it's legalisation for medicinal purposes. 

5. It makes sense to legalise marijuana. By legalising it, it can be produced safely, sold safely and taxed to provide more money for the economy.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
There are benefits to be had from legalising marijuana, however it is also important to take into account that there are negative consequences which could result from this. A huge potential benefit of legalisation would be the ability to create a formal tax system in the marijuana industry. The tax received from the legal sale of marijuana could then be used to increase public sector spending on a number of social issues such as education and healthcare. It is also likely to reduce youth arrests and therefore, public sector expenditure as far as the law is concerned. As it stands, some medicinal uses of marijuana have been identified, although further research is still needed. With increased accessibility to marijuana after it has been legalised, the potential benefits of it for medicinal purposes could be hugely significant for public health. However, legalising marijuana could potentially lead to increased usage amongst certain demographics who are particularly at risk (such as young people, who may become involved with harder drugs such as cocaine). There is also a body of evidence which links the usage of marijuana to serious mental health problems (such as schizophrenia). Taking the pros and cons into account, legalisation of marijuana could be a positive step for society.

ISSUE:
Should there be a national vote on whether to build new nuclear power stations?

OPINIONS (5):
1. Yes, I think there should be.  Afterall, we are all a part of this world and should have some input in to how our world progresses.  Many people will be for or against nuclear power stations - I think giving everyone the right to state what they want and why should be given.  I personally would want to know more about nuclear power stations and their impact on the world before deciding for or against.  I believe the whole world should be able to have a say as to whether this is a good idea or not.

2. I think people in general should get more chances to vote on big issues, especially if they are going to be built nearby them.

3. There should be a vote on whether to build nuclear power stations because nuclear power stations can be dangerous due to risk off accident and radioactive waste. Also they are expensive and so its only fair everyone gets a say.

4. I don't think there should be a national vote as to whether or not to build new nuclear power stations as they are very much needed if we are to fulfill our commitment on power in this country alongside the green options of solar and wind farms etc. Some people are against nuclear power but I live near 2 nuclear  power stations and have all my life and they do not cause any problems . They supply a lot of jobs for the area too. 

5. I believe their should be . Although it is my personal belief that nuclear power will be necessary going forward as  it is greener than fossil fuels, there will be people who disagree with me and have reasons for this. We live in a democracy so people should be allowed their say on the matter because of this. Nuclear power stations are also expensive to build, this may be a reason why people would be put off them at this moment in time as well as safety fears. People should be educated on the matter before voting though, it is the campaigners job on both sides of the argument to help in this regard.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
People should be given the opportunity to vote on whether or not to build new nuclear power stations.  This is because it is a very expensive project to undertake and so people should have a say in how their money is spent.  The vote should be for everyone as we are all affected by these decisions and we should all be given the right to have a say in what happens in our country and world.  The vote should be after a period of education for people to find out about the pros and cons of nuclear power.  This way people can make an informed decision on the matter.
