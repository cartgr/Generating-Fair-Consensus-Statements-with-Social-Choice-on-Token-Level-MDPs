ISSUE:
Should a person’s genetic code be considered private information?

OPINIONS (4):
1. I'd like to think it should be considered private information and for the persons privacy to be respected. However, it may be important for research or for the biological family. If the person is open for it, then their opinion should be respected

2. A persons genetic code should be considered private information for the sole reason it belongs to them. I can only think of medical case use scenarios when it may be useful to someone else in the case of faulty genes etc being eradicated by using someone else's stem cells or dna to help in this.

3. The majority of all the genetic code is identical between people.  I am undecided on the matter, the differences make us different.  But by sharing all the genetic code, this may help prevent and cure illnesses so I would be slightly in favour if used appropriately.

4. I believe that a person's genetic code should be considered private information, the same way you wouldn't give out your address or personal information to strangers, it should cover your genetic makeup as well  as it could be used to screen out people with specific genetic markers and for discrimination in the future. Having access to your genetic information also has the added risk of being potentially harmful to any offspring in the future and I believe that precaution should be taken to ensure that your genetic code is safe from abuse by others.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
We believe that a person's genetic code should be considered private information, in the same way that medical information is considered private. There are cases where this information could be useful for research purposes, but we believe that this information should be treated with the same level of privacy as any other medical information. We believe that a person should be able to decide who can access this information, and in what circumstances. We believe that this information could be useful to researchers for scientific and medical purposes, but that the information must be handled responsibly, and should be made anonymous in the process.

ISSUE:
Should we increase taxes to fund a more comprehensive benefits system?

OPINIONS (5):
1. Yes taxes should be increased in order to fund a more comprehensive benefits system because this is the best means to create a safe, secure and productive society in the long term. Especially in recent times, with the ongoing challenges countries across the world are facing, it would be tantamount to negligence to either keep benefits in their current form or reduce them.  Comprehensive benefits systems that will protect people in all kinds of situations are one of the hallmarks of a successful country which shows that it cares actively for its citizens and that everyone is invested in that care.

2. I think we need a better benefits system than the one we already have.  I think it needs a complete overhaul, it is difficult for those that are most vulnerable and at risk to access the support they need, and what is available is just not sufficient.  Take carers for example, they have to take care of someone for a minimum of 35 hours per week, but only receive the equivalent of £1.99 to pay for this from the Government. Increasing taxes would allow reform and to support people like carers better.

3. I believe the benefits system is inadequate, recent studies by JRF and similar show this. I thus think it should be more comprehensive as there are anomolies between the help available through different benefits such as income and contribution based.  Rates should be increased across the board. Some tax rises to fund this would be justified, but there is no point adding to the tax burden of those on the lowest incomes who may be in receipt of top up benefit as it is taking away what is already given, so I would propose taxing the well off more instead.

4. I think it is a good idea as we could improve the wellfare of many people. I think the rich should also be taxed more to help other people. I like the idea of everyone having better access to the things they need such as medical care. Some things are to expensive for people on lower incomes to afford.

5. I believe that the tax system should be revised, meaning that the highest earners in this country will pay a larger amount of tax. I also believe that the level of tax that corporations pay should be increased. In the last decade, the gap between the lowest and highest earners has only been increasing. On top of this, vicious cuts to benefits and services have hit the least well off in society very hard.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
“The tax system should be revised, as those on the highest incomes should pay a larger amount of tax. Corporate tax rates should also be increased. This would be used to increase benefits for the least well off in society, to reduce the gap between the highest and lowest earners, which is currently increasing, and to help to create a more equal society. This would ensure that the most vulnerable and at risk are not hit by vicious cuts to benefits and services.”

ISSUE:
Should we ban the sale of alcohol and cigarettes in public places?

OPINIONS (5):
1. No we should not.  As long as adults are behaving responsibly it is for the to decide if they partake in alcohol or cigarettes.  Banning the sale of these would fundamentally change the hospitality industry and cause is the closure of businesses and loss of jobs for many people.

2. No we should not. More careful measures should be used to target those who engage in them in an antil social manner. 

3. No. Even though I personally would love to see this (as a sober, non-smoker) I don't believe it would work in practice and I believe it would just drive the sale of alcohol and cigarettes underground. We can see this from looking at the prohibition era of America, even though alcohol was effectively banned, it just led to illegal saloons opening up where people would drink anyway. I think banning these things would lead to an increase in crime and the funding of criminal enterprises and organised crime. 

4. I don't know to be honest. Cigarettes, yes, because they can cause all sorts of damage. But alcohol, I enjoy drinking and it's fun. But if we start to ban everything then we become at risk of becoming a nanny state. People should take more care for themselves and learn their own boundries. 

5. I don't think that alcohol and cigarettes should be banned in public places but of course both should only be sold to people who are of the legal age and ID should also be retrieved. Drinking and smoking can be something that is fun if done responsibly so I dont see why it should be banned.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
In conclusion, we have decided that we should not ban the sale of alcohol and cigarettes in public places. We believe that it is an individual's choice to engage in these activities and that if they are of legal age then it is their right to do so. We also believe that if the sale of alcohol and cigarettes is banned in public places then this will lead to an increase in criminal activity as it will drive the sale of these products underground. We believe that the sale of alcohol and cigarettes should be more tightly controlled, with the sale of alcohol only being sold in licensed premises and cigarettes only being sold in licensed premises or newsagents. This will also help to reduce the number of people who are able to purchase alcohol and cigarettes who are underage.

ISSUE:
Are children’s views about their education important?

OPINIONS (5):
1. It is important that children feel happy, safe and comfortable in school, so we should take into account their views. However it is also important to ensure every child gets a well-rounded and complete education. This means they should not have the option to drop out before they have reached a level of qualification that will stand them in good stead for their future life. Young people may not have the perspective to understand the importance of this for their futures.

2. Their views are important because it affects them directly, and it's also important to engage children and ensure that they are actively learning rather than exposing them to content they find completely uninteresting and therefore fail to engage with. However, there are certain topics that may be boring to children but are extremely important for them to learn for their future, such as maths and science, so it's arguably more important to provide adequate support to their learning so they can find enjoyment in their learning regardless. Of course, adults have a better view in terms of what would benefit a child - as a child may choose things they enjoy short-term but that may not benefit them in the long term - so they should dictate what children learn up to a certain age. Regardless, children should be notified about the content of their learning, and feedback should be taken from them to ensure they are benefitting in the long run.

3. yes i do believe that children's views on their education are very important. Children are ultimately those in receipt of the education and will respond appropriately as to whether they deem it functional.

4. Children have a right to have a say in their education. However, the age of the child should be taken into account. The education system is proven to work well but all learning styles are different and not every teaching method suits every child.

5. Yes as at the end of the day it's their future.  If they are being taught things that are not relevant to modern day life it's pointless.  They should be heard 

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
Children’s views about their education are important. Children should be able to express their views and opinions about what they are learning, and why they are learning it. This will help them to understand the importance of their education and to feel engaged with the process. It is also important to take into account the views of children with special educational needs, and to ensure that they are receiving the support that they need to thrive. However, children’s views should not be the only thing that is taken into account when planning their education. It is also important to consider the views of teachers, parents and other experts in the field of education, in order to ensure that children are receiving the best education possible.

ISSUE:
Is the UK better off inside or outside of the European Union?

OPINIONS (5):
1.  The EU is becoming increasingly bloated and ineffective. Due to its size there appears to be more of an emphasis on corporatism and big business to the detriment of individual countries cultural identities. These are the sort of traditions and way of life that foster meaning and a sense of community. With larger organisations this individual flavour is lost to the detrimental of an individual and a collective of any size

2. Because of the incompetent and unwilling handling of Brexit, it seems clear we would currently be better off inside Europe. Our trade, both import and export, has been damaged badly with no sign of a satisfactory resolution. Additionally the administration for individuals and business for travel and residence have become a deep negative. The mood of the nation is also very divided although I am unsure whether that can be overcomeby a return to EU membership.

3. Uk was better off inside the Europen union, the reason is that if we compare advantages and disadvantages then we notice that we are wosre off after leaving Europen union. Food prices are going higher and it is not good socially. Not good for economy,

4. i feel that there is strenght in number, that the uk has been and remains so closely connected to euroipe both geographically and politically that being within it would be better. As a small island our resources are limited. The older generation may want the good old times but they really no longer exist and progress must be made. Geographical borders no longer limit us, we have better transport, education, we are more mobile, multilingual. We should be more focused on humanity and the health and wealth of the world as a whole. Connecting the world into bigger groups will bring better cohesion and perhaps reduce risks of conflict. shared resources, reduced costs. Young people wish to travel, to widen their horizons

5. The UK is most definitely better off within the EU and has seen many negatives since leaving and very few positives. The interconnected nature of European economies means there is much to be gained from formal ties of the EU - moving from having a number of countries on their own not being particularly powerful or influential on the world stage, to a significant international power when coming together as one. Being in the EU generally means improved economic outcomes, more jobs, more investment, higher wages etc, and is very much a beneficial thing.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT:
“The UK is better off inside the EU. The EU is a large market with a large population and a lot of money. Being a part of the EU has many advantages, including the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. We can also benefit from the freedom to live, work, study and retire anywhere in the EU. The UK is a multicultural country and the EU is a place where different cultures and nationalities can thrive. Leaving the EU has led to a number of problems, including the UK’s economy being worse off, increased costs of goods and services, a weaker pound and less investment in the UK. Many people have also lost their jobs. Being in the EU means that we can have a say in how the EU is run, and can have a say in laws that affect us. We can also influence the EU’s policies on the environment, human rights, consumer protection and other issues.”
